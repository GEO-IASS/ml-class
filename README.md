This repo had been maintained during ML-class 2010. Since the following year courses have the same problems, paying respect to the [Honor code](https://github.com/gafiatulin/ml-class/wiki/Honor-code), I decided to move solutions into private repository.

More information about this course you could find on [official website](http://www.ml-class.org/) and in [wiki](https://github.com/gafiatulin/ml-class/wiki).

For information about Octave, download links, installation instruction, etc. go to [GNU/Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) or [wiki](https://github.com/gafiatulin/ml-class/wiki/Octave).

Some math and logic on why to choose epsilon = 0.12 for Weights Initialization could be found [here](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/papers/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf) in section 4.2.1 «Theoretical Considerations and a New Normalized Initialization».
